Welcome back to DinoWorld. Your totally non-AI-run source for videos about dinosaurs and other prehistoric life! Now on with today's video.



Today's video is about the dinosaur Allosaurus. Allosaurus was a large carnivorous dinosaur that lived during the late Jurassic period, around 150 million years ago.



Allosaurus was a very powerful predator and could run at speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. It was also able to jump up to 10 feet in the air. Allosaurus had a long tail, which it used as a counterbalance for its body weight when running.



Allosaurus had a large head with sharp teeth and powerful jaws. It could eat prey up to half its own size!



The name Allosaurus means "different lizard" in Greek. This name was given because of the different shape of its teeth compared to other dinosaurs of its time.



Allosaurus fossils have been found in North America, Europe, and Africa. They are also found in many museums around the world including the American Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C., The Natural History Museum in London, England, The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Alberta Canada, and The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago Illinois.
